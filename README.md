Sitecore Proxy Gutter Icon
==========================

This project creates a gutter icon in the Sitecore Content Editor for indicating proxies.  It is modeled after the Clone icon that is included out of the box.  Clicking on the proxy icon will take you to the original item.  If the proxy is based on an item in another database, this is indicated in the tooltip. 

This should work on all Sitecore 6.X installations.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dsolovay/Sitecore-Proxy-Gutter-Icon/wiki| Wiki) for an introduction with screenshots.  This project is also discussed in this [blog post](http://dan-explorations.blogspot.com/2011/11/creating-gutter-icon-for-proxies.html).
